# Stellar-Dex-Chat

A decentralized exchange (DEX) interface prioritizing seamless asset-to-bank conversions leveraging AI-assisted conversations and automated Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network.

## Overview

Stellar-Dex-Chat connects natural AI conversation flows with Stellar's fast blockchain technology to create an intuitive platform for cryptocurrency to fiat conversions. Users interact with an AI assistant that securely triggers smart contract interactions (utilizing Soroban) directly from the chat UI.

## Quick Start

For detailed installation instructions, architecture overview, and development setup, see the main documentation in [Dechat/README.md](Dechat/README.md).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm
- Rust & Cargo tooling with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Stellar CLI (for interacting with Soroban)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for quick start).

### Fastest Start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leojay-net/Stellar-Dex-Chat.git
cd Stellar-Dex-Chat
cp .env.docker Dechat/dex_with_fiat_frontend/.env.local
docker compose up
```

The services will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Soroban RPC: http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc
- Horizon API: http://localhost:8000

Enable declaration emission with stripInternal and point package.json "types" at dist/measurement.d.ts. The test-only
_resetSimulationHelperState helper is marked @internal, so it is left out of the published declarations but stays in the JavaScript.

tests/type-declarations.test.cjs packs the real tarball, installs it in an isolated consumer and compiles a strict TypeScript consumer against it. It also checks that API misuse and imports of stripped internals fail to compile.

Packaging docs are updated and the provenance manifest is regenerated. The Action bundles are unchanged.
